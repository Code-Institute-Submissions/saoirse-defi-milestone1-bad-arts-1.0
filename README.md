Bad Arts Entertainment Webpage

This webpage has been designed for a Limerick based rap label which represents 8 distinct artist/group of artists.
The objective of the project is to create a one-stop shop for Bad Arts Entertainment which can pull their media from several different websites (tweets, music released on Bandcamp & videos from Youtube).
It will also be used as a promotional tool to advertise album releases, merchandise and previous concerts they have done while also allowing the label to build a community of fans.


UX

Bad Arts Entertainment already have a previously designed logo, an orange smiley face on a black background with red lettering.
Before I started the design process, I wanted to create a user interface which worked in haromony with their logo & brand indentity.
Irish rap music is quite a niche genre and the UX had to engage this small target audience. 
To reflect the tone of the music, I used a black background with the logo's bold orange colouring and an olive green as a secondary colour to balance out the colour scheme.
The main font chosen was Grenze Gotisch which has been used on several prominent rap albums and is now considered to be a part of rap culture.
